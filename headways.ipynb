    "### What This Does\n",
    "\n",
    "This code calculates headways for each CTA bus stop on a given route and direction.  It also generates\n",
    "summary stats for an entire route (min, max, mean, median, 25th percentile, and 75th percentile headways).\n",
    "\n",
    "### To Do Next\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fix late night headway issue\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add summary stats to the stops geodataframe so they show up in the visualizations when you hover over a stop\n",
    "\n",
    "- See what happens if you try to loop through many - or all - routes and compile a larger headways dataframe\n",
    "\n",
    "- Investigate EWT calcs Sean MacMullan found: https://www.trapezegroup.com.au/resources/infographic-how-to-calculate-excess-waiting-time/ \n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "One bus route can be made up of several patterns.  Headways are calculated for all buses running the same direction on a given route at a particular stop, regardless which pattern the bus is on.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Vehicle data comes from the Chi Hack Night Ghost Buses breakout team: https://ghostbuses.com/about\n",
    "This provides location information in 5 minute intervals for every CTA bus.  It includes\n",
    "data on which route (rt) and pattern (pid) the bus was running, along with the vehicle's distance along the pattern (pdist) and a timestamp.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Pattern data comes from the CTA's API directly. This tells us which stops are found along\n",
    "a given pattern and the distance along the pattern where each stop is located.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining the datasets above, the general strategy is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Turn vehicle data into intervals:  Time and distance are recorded at the start and end of each 5-minute interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For a given stop and pattern, find all intervals where a vehicle on that pattern reached or pased the stop.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Estimate the time each bus acutally reached the stop through interpolation.  The interval gives time and distance location along a given pattern before and after the bus arrived at the stop.  The CTA's pattern data tells us where the bus stop falls along the pattern.  Stop times are estimated assuming the vehicle travels a constant spaeed througout the interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Combine all stop times for buses running the same direction at a particular stop.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Calculate headways between buses based on stop times.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Calculate summary statistics on headways.\n"

    "Address late night routes. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Some buses run past midnight, so the first bus of the calendar day appears just after midnight. \n",
    "- Many of these have no scheduled service in the early morning hours, but the unscheduled hours show up as a long headway.  And different directions of travel may begin and end service at different times. \n",
    "    - Need to change the range of times where data is used so it doesn't assume buses should be running during their off time  \n",
    "    - (Example: see first bus/last bus info on the 55 bus here: https://www.transitchicago.com/bus/55/)\n",
    "        - Parts of this route run 24 hours\n",
    "        - Parts run 5am to 2am\n",
    "        - Parts run 4:10 am to 1:10am\n",
    "        - First and last buses reach mid-route stops later than these ranges. Buses continue to the end of their route\n",
    "        - not in service times between 5am and 2am show up in the code below as long headways\n",
    " \n",
    "- Possible Approach?\n",
    "\n",
    "    - DONE: Combine 2 days of data: the \"main\" date being looked at and the following date for any schedules that splill into overnight.  How to choose a new range that starts and ends with the out-of-service period?\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Investigate the schedule data from CTA. Can we extract actual start/end times for a route/direction, adding a buffer of extra time on the end to capture buses finishing their routes at end of the schedule? \n",
    "\n",
    "- Also, this code currently eliminates all intervals where one timestamp is before midnight and the next is after, since it uses one calendar day of data.  Missing one inverval per day is less critical than the issue above, and it would likely be resolved by the same fixes.\n",
