Learning about APIs while exploring CTA Bus Tracker data.  Inspired and informed by following the team at https://github.com/chihacknight/chn-ghost-buses.

A CTA Bus Tracker API key is required.  Create one by following the instructions at https://www.transitchicago.com/developers/bustracker/

Create a .env file in your project, and add:
API_KEY='<your key>'

pip install -r requirements.txt will install all the required libraries.
