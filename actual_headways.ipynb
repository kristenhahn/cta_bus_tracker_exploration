    "NOTE: Headways for late night routes are not accurate yet - See the Needs Fixing section below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What This Does\n",
    "\n",
    "- Calculates actual headways for each CTA bus stop on a given route, direction, service date, and start/end time. Actual headways are based on CTA Bus Tracker GPS data. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Generates summary stats for an entire route (min, max, mean, median, 25th percentile, and 75th percentile headways).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Calculate Average Wait Times (AWT) - thanks to Sean MacMullan.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## In progress\n",
    "\n",
    "- Calculate scheduled headways at each stop, making sure they make sense given different patterns that\n",
    "run at different times of day for each route\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## To Do Next\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add summary stats to the stops geodataframe so they show up in the visualizations when you hover over a stop\n",
    "\n",
    "- Investigate EWT calcs Sean found: https://www.trapezegroup.com.au/resources/infographic-how-to-calculate-excess-waiting-time/ \n",
    "\n",
    "- See what happens if you try to loop through many - or all - routes and compile a larger headways dataframe\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "One bus route can be made up of several patterns.  Headways are calculated for all buses running the same direction on a given route at a particular stop, regardless which pattern the bus is on.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Vehicle data comes from the Chi Hack Night Ghost Buses breakout team: https://ghostbuses.com/about\n",
    "This provides location information in 5 minute intervals for every CTA bus.  It includes\n",
    "data on which route (rt) and pattern (pid) the bus was running, along with the vehicle's distance along the pattern (pdist) and a timestamp.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Pattern data comes from the CTA's API directly. This tells us which stops are found along\n",
    "a given pattern and the distance along the pattern where each stop is located.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strategy for Actual Headways\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining the datasets above, the general strategy is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Turn vehicle data into intervals:  Time and distance are recorded at the start and end of each 5-minute interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For a given stop and pattern, find all intervals where a vehicle on that pattern reached or pased the stop.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Estimate the time each bus acutally reached the stop through interpolation.  The interval gives time and distance location along a given pattern before and after the bus arrived at the stop.  The CTA's pattern data tells us where the bus stop falls along the pattern.  Stop times are estimated assuming the vehicle travels a constant spaeed througout the interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Combine all stop times for buses running the same direction at a particular stop.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Calculate headways between buses based on stop times.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Calculate summary statistics on headways.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strategy for Scheduled Headways (Tentative)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Which patterns/shapes serve a given stop?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When are the earliest/latest times those patterns are in effect?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What are the headways within each timeframe?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Needs Fixing\n",
    "\n",
    "Address late night routes. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Some buses run past midnight, so the first bus of the calendar day appears just after midnight. \n",
    "- Many of these have no scheduled service in the early morning hours, but the unscheduled hours show up as a long headway.  And different directions of travel may begin and end service at different times. \n",
    "    - This code lets you choose a timeframe to analyze, but pinning down what ranges to use is tricky - need more work on this. \n",
    "    -\n",
    "- Possible Approach?\n",
    "\n",
    "    - DONE: Combine 2 days of data: the \"main\" date being looked at and the following date for any schedules that splill into overnight. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - How do we choose a range of time for each stop that doesn't include overnight out-of-service periods (which would show up as long headways)? Investigate the schedule data from CTA. Can we extract actual start/end times for a route/direction, adding a buffer of extra time on the end to capture buses finishing their routes at end of the schedule? See strategy for scheduled headways above."
